# My Next.js App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
this should download node_module

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


Testing
To run the tests, use:
npm test
# or
yarn test

Ensure you have the necessary testing dependencies installed by running:
npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
# or
yarn add --dev jest babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
